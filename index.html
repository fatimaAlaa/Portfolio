                        My expertise in this area was acquired over a period of
                        six months. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to
                        participate in an intensive course sponsored by Meta.
                        The course was also facilitated by She Codes Too (SCT),
                        a renowned organization dedicated to empowering women in
                        the tech industry. Through this immersive learning
                        experience, I was able to acquire in-depth knowledge and
                        hands-on experience.

                        I attained a high level of expertise in Flutter through
                        a two-month intensive course offered by Zain Iraq, one
                        of the leading telecommunications companies in the
                        country. This focused program provided an in-depth
                        understanding of Flutter and its practical application
                        in developing high-quality native interfaces on both iOS
                        and Android platforms. This experience was
                        instrumental in my journey as it expanded my knowledge and provided me

                    My portfolio encompasses projects utilizing Flutter and
                    front-end development methodologies. These Flutter projects
                    demonstrate building mobile applications, employing a deep
                    understanding of Dart language and efficient handling of
                    Flutter widgets. Concurrently, my front-end projects
                    underline my capability to create engaging and responsive
                    user interfaces, leveraging modern technologies such as
                    HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, all aimed at enhancing user
